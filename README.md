# React Native Application

This is a multi-page React Native application created as part of the Webyapar internship assignment. The app utilizes various libraries such as NativeWind, React Navigation, Axios, and Expo ImagePicker to create a seamless user experience across different screens.

## Usage

The app allows users to perform various actions, including:

- Input latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Select images from the device's image library or take new photos using the device's camera.
- Submit form data, including latitude, longitude, and selected images, to a remote server using Axios.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following libraries:

- NativeWind: A utility-first CSS framework for styling React Native applications.
- React Navigation: A routing and navigation library for React Native apps.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- Expo ImagePicker: A library for accessing the device's image library and camera to select or capture images.
